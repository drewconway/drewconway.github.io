          <ul>
            <li>My recruitment to Two Sigma began during the M&A process for Alluvium. Two Sigma had been developing a strategy for building a data-driven private markets business in 2018, and had approached me about acquiring Alluvium as a possible acqui-hire to establish the initial team for the new venture. Ultimately the M&A process moved away from Two Sigma, but I reconnected with the team a few months after the Augury acquisition. They offered me the opportunity to join and begin developing the initial platform for the data-driven private markets business, focusing on commercial real estate as the initial asset class.</li>
            <li>Today, <a href="https://www.twosigma.com/businesses/real-estate/">Two Sigma Real Estate</a> is the largest new business that Two Sigma has brought to market. I have led the development of all of our internal models and tools used to support and augment the sourcing and acquisition of our portfolio. As a member of the investment committee I am also involved in all acquisition processes, and have played a key role in the fundraising process for all of our joint ventures and our first dedicated real estate fund.</li>

        <div class="details">
          <ul>
            <li>I began the process of founding Alluvium immediately after Sum was shut down. I believed that while Sum’s business model was flawed, the underlying technical concept of delivering real-time insights from streaming data could be applied to several different business problems. Bringing over two senior engineers from Sum, we focused on developing a product for providing real-time and forensic analysis for large industrial platforms, specifically in continuous automation environments in the energy and material manufacturing sectors.</li>
            <li>Over three years we developed SaaS and integrated software solutions and partnered with large firms in the space, including ExxonMobil and Honeywell. Ultimately, we became an acquisition target due to our unique technical approach and early progress, but limited commercial traction. Alluvium was acquired by Augury, an Israeli-based industrial analytics business, to integrate our machine learning platform in January 2019. The product and team were fully integrated over the next few months, establishing Augury’s first technical team in the U.S. <a href="https://www.augury.com/media-center/press/augury-announces-75-million-of-funding-and-maintains-1b-valuation-as-it-accelerates-leadership-in-industrial-ai-solutions/">Today, Augury is a leader in the IoT space and valued at over $1bn+</a>.</li>
